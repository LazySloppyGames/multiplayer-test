I am not the creator of this code. It is only being used as troubleshooting and learning project.

This is based on godot-steam-multiplayer-peer-extension from BatteryAcid.
This is an attempt to find out why Steam is having an asymmetrical issue. This issue occurs on different modems and different
computers, but still causes the same issue for one person and another for the other.

For one user hosting it works fine, but when the other user hosts there is a 3 second delay in client position readings.
In addition, one side receives a large number of errors when starting, but none during gameplay, and the other receives only a few
warnings, but a ton of errors during gameplay.

The hope is to use this to find out what the issue is and to eliminate the errors and warnings on both side and achieve smooth
gameplay!
